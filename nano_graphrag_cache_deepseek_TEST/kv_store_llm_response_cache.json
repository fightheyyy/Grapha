    "return": "**Ebenezer Scrooge** is the central protagonist of the story, initially portrayed as a cold, solitary, and miserly old man who despises Christmas, human sympathy, and generosity. He is a tight-fisted, grasping, and covetous individual, embodying greed and isolation, and is disliked by those around him, including his nephew, niece, and the Cratchit family. As the sole executor of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley’s estate, Scrooge owns a counting-house and lives a life marked by bitterness and indifference to the suffering of the poor.  \n\nHis transformation begins when he is visited by the ghost of Marley, who warns him of the impending arrival of three spirits. Initially skeptical and unafraid, Scrooge soon trembles with fear and confusion as he confronts these supernatural encounters. Through interactions with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come, he is forced to observe scenes from his own life—his lonely childhood, his past interactions with figures like Fezziwig, and the bleak future that awaits him if he does not change.  \n\nThroughout these experiences, Scrooge undergoes deep emotional turmoil, shifting from dismissiveness to despair, excitement, and eventually profound reflection. He is particularly moved by the fate of Tiny Tim and rebuked for his past indifference to the poor. Witnessing his potential future and the consequences of his actions, Scrooge vows to change. By the end of his journey, he undergoes a complete transformation, embracing generosity, joy, and kindness—especially toward Bob Cratchit and his family—and becomes a symbol of redemption, honoring Christmas with a newfound spirit of goodwill.  \n\nThus, Scrooge evolves from a comical yet unpleasant miser into a warm-hearted, charitable man, embodying the story’s message of redemption and the transformative power of self-reflection.",
